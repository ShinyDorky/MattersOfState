Okay, ShinyDorky here!

If you want to write your own policies here are some pointers:

1. GUI is configured for width of 5 policies. There is nothing stopping you from adding more or less, but i wouldnt recommend it.
2. At the moment game has no way to check flags at the level of individual laws. This is upsetting, as it forced me to employ some hacks:
    2.1. You cannot really check for whether there should be a gap in between laws as far as i can see - thus you may have to create some dummy laws to avoid spacing issues
        in your lawsets. In order to make them hidden, in localization put their names as "$MOS_NULL_LAW$", which CAN be detected by gui script
    2.2. Originally I've envisioned having multiple laws available at the same x and y axis of lawGroup, so to speak, but it has proven... difficult. 
        For now it will be solved by some creative application of IF instruction, but if anyone has better ideas, I'm all ears
