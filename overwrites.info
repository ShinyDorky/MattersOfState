Files listed here are overwritten from base game. If you wish to make a compatch/mforce some mod to work with this one, you have to make sure that modifications in these files are preserved in load order.

In order to make compatching easier, all of my additions in these files are surrounded with
### MOS ###
### /MOS ###
comments. As long as you paste those in appropriate parent structures, you should be fine. 


OBLIGATORY:
gui/window_my_realm.gui
    Without this, you cannot access the MOS reforms button

RECOMMENDED:
common/council_tasks/00_chancellor_tasks.txt
common/council_tasks/00_steward_tasks.txt
common/council_tasks/00_chancellor_tasks.txt
    Those three enable MOS reforms to influence council task progress. Removeing them won't break the game, but raforms that speed up cultural conversion won't work anymore
